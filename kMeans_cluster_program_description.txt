kMeans cluster identification

Description of contents:

kMeans_v4.py
------------

- Given a 2D set of points this program will uniquely identify clusters and plot their respective centers.
- Here is the algorithm used:
   -> For each point calculate its distance and angle from origin.
   -> Generate array of size 26, where each element is a 1/26th the size of (maximum Angle - minimum Angle).
   -> Each angle interval will contain the distance values for each point that fall in that angled slice.
   -> For each angle interval (mentioned above) calculate number of points. 
   -> Identify intervals with local maximum number of points.
   -> For each local maxima find average distance value.
   -> Calculate x, y coordinates from these distance and angle pairs. These are cluster center coordinates.

- Top left plot shows distance values vs. angles for each point in input file. 
   -> this also shows lines that correspond to angle intervals with maximum number of points.
- Bottom left plot shows the same local maxima in terms of angle array indices alluded to in algorithm description.
- Top right plot shows initial plot with line segments where vertices are cluster centers.

- X and Y values for each point is tabulated.
